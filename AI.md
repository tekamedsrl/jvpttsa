Starting from the patient recognition, patient name acquisition, pixel size calculation and ROI defnrion,
all by using direct camera acquired images.

Where AI is requested:
- Patient name acquired by OCR instead DICOM flow
- Echo images are processed on libe by an extarnal camera
- Pixel size is obtained by cm reference displayed on the monitor
